bypass Okta Verify
==================
This is a manual on how to use Okta Verify without a phone.

1. Install pass-otp from https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp#installation .

2. Navigate to your organisation's Okta settings. The url is typically of the
   form https://OKTA_HOME_PAGE/enduser/settings.

For example,
- The University of Sydney: https://sso.sydney.edu.au/enduser/settings
- Garvan: https://garvan.okta.com/enduser/settings

3. Scroll to "Extra Verification". This is typically on the right at the bottom.

4. If you already have Okta Verify set up with your organisation, remove it
   from your account. Otherwise, go to step 5.

4.1. Click "Remove" next to "Okta Verify".
4.2. Click "Yes".

5. Retrieve the secret OTP key.

5.1. Click "Set up" next to "Okta Verify".
5.2. Click "Set up" again.
5.3. Click "iPhone" or "Android". It doesn't matter which one you pick, you
  won't be needing a phone.
5.4. Click "Next".
5.5. Click "Can't scan?".
5.6. Click the first dropdown menu and select "Setup manually without push
  notification".
5.7. Copy the greyed out secret key to your clipboard.
5.8. Save it somewhere in the rare case you accidentally lose it after
  finishing step 10 and can't login.

6. Run the following command in a terminal, replacing OTP_NAME with a name of
   your choosing. Paste the secret key when prompted.
```sh
pass otp insert -esi bypass OTP_NAME
```

7. Click "Next".

8. Run the following command in a terminal and copy the 6-digit number.
```sh
pass otp OTP_NAME
```
Alternatively, use the `-c` option to copy it directly.
```sh
pass otp -c OTP_NAME
```

9. Paste the number in the "Enter Code" text box.

10. Click "Verify" to finish the setup.

11. Now, whenever you are required to enter the OTP code in the future, simple
    follow steps 8 and 9.

(Optional) 12. Add the account to your Okta Verify app.

12.1. Open the Okta Verify app.
12.2. Press the "+" button in the top-right corner.
12.3. Press "Other".
12.4. Press "Enter Key Manually".
12.5. Type an Account Name of your choosing.
12.6. Type in the secret Key from step 5.7. If you have lost it, run the
   following command to retrieve it.
```sh
pass OTP_NAME | awk -F '[=&]' '{print $2}'
```
12.7. Click "Done".
12.8. Confirm you get the same codes on your phone as when following step 8. If
   not, you may have misspelled the secret key in step 12.6, in which case
   start again from step 12.2.
12.9. If your old account is still on the Okta Verify app you can remove it.
12.9.1. Press the ">" button next to the old account.
12.9.2. Press "Delete Account" then "Delete".
